# 📝 Description

Amazon video dataset provides information on how many titles people watch and what genre. My task here was to create a PowerBI dashboard to offer visualizations and insights into amazon video progression on movies, tv shows and their genres.

# 📝 Things I've Done

🔹 Imported Excel COVID-19 dataset into PowerBI
🔹 Removed irrelevant or redundant column handled missing values
🔹 Create filters without being dinamic just to see the totals and dates
🔹 Have a proper image to see how it growed by years

# 📌 Insights

🔹 Important KPI are movies and TV shows watched in quantities
🔹 How many titles and their rating 
🔹 The date from the beginning till the end of the year
🔹 Genres by total shows to realize what genre is the most watched
🔹 Total genres and directors in this dataset

# ✔ Conclusion

✴ "This dashboard aims to provide a tool for public and amazon video to realize which genres are the most viewed and know where to row to improve the application." ✴
